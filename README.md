CACHE is an online sales, auction, and bartering app. It combines the Auction and Buy-it-Now features of eBay, along with the open offer features of Craigslist. CACHE takes the most powerful features of traditional auction and classified websites and puts them together in a modern and elegant interface that makes it easy for buyers and sellers to connect and transact.
